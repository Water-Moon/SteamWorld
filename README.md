SteamWorld
===================
**Welcome to the SteamWorld Minecraft Mod repository!**

## What is "SteamWorld"?
SteamWorld is a Minecraft modification that uses the Forge API. It adds in several machines to the game that make use of fluids to process an input to an output. These machines can be upgraded at a cost to enhance their abilities.
